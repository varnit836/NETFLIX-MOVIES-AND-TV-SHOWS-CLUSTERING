# NETFLIX-MOVIES-AND-TV-SHOWS-CLUSTERING
Introduction Netflix, the world’s largest on-demand internet streaming media and online DVD movie rental service provider.it Founded August 29, 1997, in Los Gatos, California by Marc and Reed. It has 69 million members in over 60 countries enjoying more than 100 million hours of TV shows and movies per day Netflix is the world’s leading internet entertainment service with enjoying TV series, documentaries, and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. I was curious to analyze the content released in Netflix platform which led me to create these simple, interactive, and exciting visualizations and find similar groups of people.

# Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to find similarity within groups of people to build a movie recommendation system for users. We are going to analyze a dataset from the Netflix database to explore the characteristics that people share in movies. We have experienced it ourselves or have been in the room, the endless scrolling of selecting what to watch. Users spend more time deciding what to watch than watching their movie.

# Solutions:
Having a deeper understanding of what problem we are trying to solve, what the users’ needs, and frustrations are, and what the goals are for achieving the best possible solution for both for the business as well as the user, I began by listing out the possible solutions that were arrived from the research.

Improve rating system: Use the star rating rather than a thumbs up and thumbs down rating system to help guide in decision making when selecting a film. Separate recently watched: Hide the movies and TV-Shows on a separate page so users don’t have to scroll through those already seen. — users have to do more searching Randomize a Movie: When users are unsure of what to choose, Netflix will randomly select something to watch based on their viewing history. Show popular/trending films: Create a category which showcases only trending content. Connect with Friends: It was proven that users watch shows and movies based on friend recommendations so this may be useful for keeping users locked into Netflix for longer. Organizing films by the mood: Alongside the genres filter, it may be possible to organize content based on the mood that is experienced after watching the film.

Conclusion
it will solve for improved movie and TV-Show selection times with a considerable growth in satisfaction of the content being consumed leading to more user engagement and greater trust in Netflix recommendations.
